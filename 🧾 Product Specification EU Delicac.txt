ChatGPT said:

Perfect — let’s create a Cursor-ready project document that clearly defines your app’s concept, structure, and development direction.

This document will help Cursor automatically scaffold the Next.js site “EUdelicacies”, with strong design guidance, features, and component logic.

🧾 EUdelicacies — Project Specification Document (for Cursor)
🧠 Concept

EUdelicacies is a web platform where people in the European Union can explore, buy, or trade local delicacies from neighboring countries.

It bridges cultural gastronomy and local commerce, letting customers order authentic products directly from artisans or small-scale importers.

We’re still exploring the business angle — it might serve both:

🧺 Consumers (small personal orders)

🧳 Small retailers / importers (wholesale samples)

🎯 Goals

Create a beautiful, trustworthy marketplace experience for exploring food by country.

Highlight authenticity, storytelling, and connection — it’s about discovering the “taste of Europe”.

Support both small local producers and cross-border food lovers.
